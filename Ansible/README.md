# Ansible automation platform



## Architecture

## Playbooks
- written in .yaml files
- defines WHAT has to be applied to a device

## Inventory
- A list of devices divided into groups

## Module
- a piece of extra code that will make it possible that ansible can translate WHAT needs to be changed into effectively connecting to the device and adjust the configuration if needed.
